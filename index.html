                <h1>JAVA</h1>
          <h3>General Overview</h3>
          <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995.
            It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
            Java is commonly used for developing a wide range of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, enterprise software, and more </p>
          <h3>Key Features of Java</h3>
          <p>Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented programming(OOP) paradigm, which emphasizes the use of objects and classes for structuring code.
            Platform-Independent: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any platform that has a JVM. This allows Java applications to be run on different operating systems without modification.</p>
            <h1>MySQL</h1>
            <h3>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</h3>
          <p>MySQL is a type of database management system that stores data in tables and allows users to define relationships between the tables.
         It follows the relational model, which organizes data into related tables consisting of rows and columns.
         Overall, MySQL is a versatile and reliable database management system widely used in a variety of applications and industries, from small-scale websites to large enterprise systems. Its open-source nature, performance, and scalability make it a popular choice for developers and organizations worldwide.</p>
           <h1>HTML</h1>
           <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It provides a structure for web content by using a system of tags and attributes to define various elements on a web page. Here's an overview of HTML</p>
           <h3>Structure of HTML</h3>
           <p>HTML documents are composed of elements, which are enclosed in opening and closing tags (<tag> and </tag>).
            Elements can contain text, other elements, or both.
            The basic structure of an HTML document includes:
            <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
            <html>: The root element that contains all other elements on the page.
            <head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the page title, character encoding, and links to external resources.
            <body>: Contains the main content of the document, including text, images, links, and other elements visible to the user.</p>
           <h1>CSS</h1>
           <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the visual appearance of web pages by defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other aspects of the content. Here's an overview of CSS</p>
           <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
           <p>CSS can be used to create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
            Media queries allow developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as screen width, height, and orientation.
            Techniques like fluid layouts, flexible images, and viewport units enable the creation of designs that scale and reflow gracefully across various devices.
            CSS is a fundamental technology for web development, working in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create engaging and visually appealing web experiences. Mastering CSS allows developers to control the presentation and layout of web content effectively.</p>
            <h1>Java Script</h1>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a versatile and powerful programming language commonly used for web development.</p>
